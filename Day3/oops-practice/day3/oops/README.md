# Object-Oriented Programming Questions (Java)

This repository contains solutions to various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problems in **Java**.

## Questions

1. **Student Class**  
   Create a class called `Student` that stores student name, class, section, and marks in 4 subjects.  
   - Implement constructors, getter/setters, behaviors, and operations to accept and display data.  
   - Provide methods to return total and percentage.  
   - Test the class in a main function.  

2. **Employee Class**  
   Create a class called `Employee` that stores name, department, designation, and basic salary.  
   - Implement constructors, getter/setters, behaviors, and operations to accept and display data.  
   - Write methods to calculate incentives: HRA (20%), DA (10%), CA (10%).  
   - Test the class in a main function.  

3. **Rectangle Class (Derived from Point Class)**  
   Create a class `Rectangle` derived from `Point`.  
   - `Rectangle` should store width and height along with the `Point` class data.  
   - Implement constructors, getter/setters, behaviors, and operations to accept and display data.  
   - Write methods to calculate area and perimeter.  
   - Test the class in a main function.  

4. **Employee Inheritance (TempEmp & PerEmp)**  
   Create a base class `Employee` with `code` and `name`.  
   - Create two derived classes:  
     - `TempEmp` stores wage grade and number of days worked.  
     - `PerEmp` stores department, designation, and basic salary.  
   - Implement constructors, getter/setters, and appropriate operations.  

5. **Object Counter Class**  
   Create a class that counts the number of its objects created.  
   - If objects < 5, display “Too Less”.  
   - If objects == 5, display “Will do”.  
   - If objects > 5, display “Exceeding the Limits”.  
   - Implement constructors and methods to return the object count.
