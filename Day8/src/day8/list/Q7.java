/*Write a menu-driven Java program to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a List of Sales
Transactions. The SalesTransaction class should contain the following fields:
 transactionId (int): Transaction ID
 customerName (String): Customer's name
 product (String): Product name
 quantitySold (int): Quantity sold
 totalAmount (double): Total amount of the transaction (price * quantitySold)
Also Override equals(), int hashCode(), and String toString() methods
Menu-Driven Operations:
1. Add a Sales Transaction to the list.
2. Display all Sales Transactions in the list.
3. Update a Sales Transaction (by transactionId).
4. Delete a Sales Transaction (by transactionId).
5. Sort Sales Transactions by customer name in ascending order.
6. Sort Sales Transactions by total amount in descending order.
7. Calculate the total sales amount of all transactions.
8. Exit the program.
Additional Notes:
 Ensure that the transaction data is stored in an ArrayList<SalesTransaction>.
 Implement methods for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying sales transactions.
 Include a calculation operation to calculate the total sales amount of all transactions.
 Continuously prompt the user until they select the exit option*/
