# Assignment 2: If Conditional Statements

This repository contains Python programs based on conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to solve the following problems.

## Questions

1. Write a program that accepts a number and displays whether the entered number is an odd number or even number.
2. Write a program that accepts a number and displays the absolute value of that number.
3. Write a program that accepts 3 numbers and then displays the largest number.
4. Write a program that accepts a number and displays whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
5. Write a program that accepts three integers as angles and checks whether a triangle is valid or not.  
   (Valid Triangle: A triangle is valid if the sum of all three angles is equal to 180 degrees.)
6. Write a program that accepts product price and quantity and then calculates the revenue. If the revenue is more than 5000, a discount of 10% is offered. The program should display the discount and net revenue.  
   (Revenue = price Ã— quantity.)
7. Write a program to accept a year and print whether the year is a leap year or not.  
   (Leap Years are any year that can be evenly divided by 4. A year that is evenly divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400.)
8. Write a program to accept a character and print whether it is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or a special character.
