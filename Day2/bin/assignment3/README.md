# Assignment 3: Loops

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate the use of loops to solve various problems.

## Questions

1. **Print numbers from 1 to 100**  
   Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100.

2. **Print sum of numbers from 1 to 100**  
   Write a program to print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

3. **Print even numbers from 100 to 200**  
   Write a program to print even numbers from 100 to 200.

4. **Print numbers from 300 to 200**  
   Write a program to print numbers from 300 to 200.

5. **Print odd numbers from 300 to 200**  
   Write a program to print odd numbers from 300 to 200.

6. **Print multiples of 5 from 100 to 200**  
   Write a program to print multiples of 5 from 100 to 200.

7. **Multiplication Table**  
   Write a program that accepts a number and prints its multiplication table.

8. **Reverse Multiplication Table**  
   Write a program that accepts a number and prints its reverse multiplication table.

9. **Factorial**  
   Write a program that accepts a number and prints its factorial value.

10. **Power of a Number**  
    Write a program that accepts two numbers and finds the value of one number raised to the power of another (without using pre-defined functions).

11. **Number of Digits**  
    Write a program that accepts a number and prints the number of digits present in this number. For example, if the number is 7322, the number of digits is 4.

12. **Reverse Number**  
    Write a program that accepts a number and prints the number in reverse order. For example, if the number is 7322, the reverse number is 2237.

13. **Reverse Number (Outside Loop)**  
    Write a program that accepts a number and prints the number in reverse order. The number should be printed outside the loop. For example, if the number is 7322, the reverse number is 2237.

14. **Sum of Even and Odd Integers**  
    Write a program that accepts a number (until the user wants) of integers and prints the sum of the even and odd integers.

15. **Prime Number Check**  
    Write a program that accepts a positive integer and prints a message indicating whether the number is a prime number or not.

16. **Calculate HCF**  
    Write a program to calculate the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two given numbers.

17. **Largest and Smallest Number**  
    Write a program to enter numbers until the user wants, and then display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

18. **Armstrong Numbers**  
    Write a program to print all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. If the sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number.  
    Example: 153 = (1 * 1 * 1) + (5 * 5 * 5) + (3 * 3 * 3).

19. **Fibonacci Series**  
    Write a program to print the Fibonacci series of `n` terms where `n` is input by the user:  
    `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`.

20. **Sum of Series**  
    Write a program to calculate the sum of the following series where `n` is input by the user:  
    `1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/n`.

21. **Menu Driven Program**  
    Write a menu-driven program with the following options:
    - a. Table
    - b. Reverse Multiplication Table
    - c. Factorial value
    - d. Fibonacci series
    - e. Armstrong numbers
    - f. Exit
